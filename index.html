        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p>My name is Luca Milanese and I'm currently studying software engineering, for full-stack engineering. <br>
           I am 22 years old and have been studying this topic for under a year. My goal is to become a developer <br>
           capable of completing full projects start to finish single-handedly.
        </p>
        <p>My other interests are heavily focused on sports, I involve myself in multiple sports teams such as basketball, <br>
           and squash. Watching these sports is also a passtime of mine and a way to spend time with family members and <br>
           friends. My passion for sports and software could prove to birth an intersting line of projects and I hope to <br>
           entangle both of these topics together and use my creativity to test the limits of my abilities.
